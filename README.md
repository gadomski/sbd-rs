# sbd-rs

Native rust library to read and write Iridium Short Burt Data (SBD) messages, and an executable that exposes some of that library's functionality.
Documentation is available [online](https://docs.rs/sbd), and they include some background on Iridum and its Short Burst Data (SBD) services.

## Building the executable

To build the `sbd` executable, you need [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html).
Once you have rust, simply:

```bash
cargo install sbd
```
### Using `sbd serve` as a daemon

The executable includes a couple of powers, including a "run-forever" server for receiving Iridium SBD DirectIP messages and storing those messages to the filesystem.
This `sbd serve` power *does not* include any sort of daemonization; you have to roll your own.
I personally use [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/).

## Using the library

Include the following in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sbd = "0.3"
```
